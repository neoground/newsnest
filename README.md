**Newsnest** is a modern, self-hosted RSS reader web app, giving you complete control over your news feeds. 
Built with **PHP8** and **MySQL**, it works on any modern web host or home server,
making it easy to keep up with your favorite content in one place.

## üì∞ About the Project

Newsnest is currently in development, with an early alpha version available internally. 
We are dedicated to making this a feature-rich and user-friendly platform. 
The app supports RSS, ATOM (and soon JSON Feed), and allows you to organize and read your news feeds effortlessly.
